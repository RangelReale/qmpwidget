\section intro Introduction

QMPwidget is a small class which allows Qt developers to embed an MPlayer instance into
their application for convenient video playback. Starting with version 4.4, Qt
can be build with Phonon, the KDE multimedia framework (see
http://doc.trolltech.com/phonon-overview.html for an overview). However, the Phonon
API provides only a limited amount of functionality, which may be too limited for some
purposes.

In contrast, this class provides a way of embedding a full-fledged movie
player within an application. This means you can use all of
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/info.html">MPlayer's features</a>, but
also that you will need to ship a MPlayer binary with your application if you can't make
sure that it is already installed on a user system.

For more information about MPlayer, please visit http://www.mplayerhq.hu/ .

\section usage Usage information

\subsection addproject Including QMPwidget in your project

Please note that in the following, it is assumed you are already using
<a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qmake-running.html">QMake</a> to manage your
build system.

\subsubsection inclib As a library

Copy the \p src directory of the source distribution to your project tree. You
might want to rename it, e.g. to \p qmpwidget. Afterwards, rename \p src.pro
to match your directory name, e.g. \p qmpwidget.pro, and adjust it to your needs
(see below for available options). Finally, add the directory to your existing
\p SUBDIRS defintion of the parent directory's project file.

By default, QMPwidget will result in a single static library located in the parent
directory. Therefore, the parts of the program using the widget need to link
against it. Furthermore, the directory containing the QMPwidget source should be
included in the respective \p INCLUDEPATH definitions.

\subsubsection incclass As a class

\subsection usewidget Using QMPwidget

You can use QMPwidget just like any other QWidget. First, you should make sure
that the MPlayer path used is correct (QMPwidget::mplayerPath()). Finally, you
can pass the optional parameters of your choice and a media url to QMPwidget::start(),
which will launch MPlayer and play the media if possible.

Please refer to the QMPwidget class documentation for detailed usage information.

\section playbackmodes Video playback modes

Normally, embedding of MPlayer is done by attaching the process to an existing window.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work on Mac OS X at all, so QMPwidget provides an additional
"pipe mode" for running MPlayer on this operating system. Although this mode works on all
operating systems, the standard mode should perform significantly better in terms of
CPU usage and audio / video synchronization.

The pipe mode is included if the QMake configuration variable \p pipemode is set.

\section shortcuts Keyboard control
The following keyboard shortcuts are implemented. A table listing the
corresponding key codes can be found at the
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qt.html#Key-enum">Qt documentation</a>.

<table>
 <tr><th>Key(s)</th><th>Action</th></tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_P, \p Qt::Key_Space</td>
  <td>Toggle pause</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_F</td>
  <td>Toggle fullscreen</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_Q, \p Qt::Key_Escape</td>
  <td>Close the widget</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_Plus, \p Qt::Key_Minus</td>
  <td>Adjust audio delay by +/- 0.1 seconds</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_Left, \p Qt::Key_Right</td>
  <td>Seek backward/forward 10 seconds</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_Down, \p Qt::Key_Up</td>
  <td>Seek backward/forward 1 minute</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>\p Qt::Key_PageDown, \p Qt::Key_PageUp</td>
  <td>Seek backward/forward 10 minutes</td>
